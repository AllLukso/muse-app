# `museboard`
`museboard` empowers artists and collectors to create a global decentralised user curated gallery.


## What is `museboard`?
`museboard` is a visual social engine to discover NFTs and organise them into self curated mood boards regardless of NFT ownership.
- You do not need to own NFTs to connect your LUKSO wallet and start curating your own Boards. Keep your inspirational muse Boards easily accesible on your Universal Profile and follow those relevant to you.
- You may buy, sell or make offers on NFTs or even muse Boards.
- You can use `museboard` owning no NFTs and no LYX and even make some income.

## How do we add value

We all know there are many marketplaces. You can see collections or artists, sometimes lists curated by an individual woking for the centralised platform, but the focus of them all is on the speculation. 

- `museboard` brings something different. Sort of a WEB 3.0 "LUKSO Pink Pilled Pinterest" with the potential uses that come from the adoptions of the LSPs. 

- We FOCUS ON THE ART and the INSPIRATION you get from your muse Board. We empower users create Boards with NFTs (owned or not) an arrange them however they like creating their own beautiful mood boards that are always easily accesible on the `museboard` platform. 

- For a better world we all need to have the MUSES of the arts nearby.

- `museboard` is based on the creative community and thus is social. You may follow Brands, Artists, or Universal Profiles to see what inspires them. 
  
- `museboard` is decentralised, permission less and powered by LUKSO standard proposals and blockchain.  

### LUKSO buildup Hackathon 2022 implementation:

- Connect to the L16 Public Network.
- Import Universal Profiles and assets from the network (LYX, LSP7 and LSP8 tokens).
- Create Vaults.
- Send tokens to external addresses.
- Send tokens across vaults.
- Create muse Boards and add new NFTs (owned or not) to your gallery. 
- Follow / Unfollow for both Universal Profiles or muse Boards is done on-chain.
- Share Profiles, muse Boards and NFTs.
- Search tool to find NFTs, muse Boards or Profiles. 
- Notifications are built as a way to keep users up to date and bring value to the platform. 
- Notifications may include: 	Follows / Unfollows
  - Trade info such as Offers accept/refused, 
  - The owner of an NFT that you offered to buy makes a new ask.
  - An NFT or Board you owned and were selling is sold.  
  - NFTs being sold somewhere we follow... 
  - new NFTs added to a Followed Profile / muse Board.

Following the lighthouse of our mission, empower Artists and enthusiasts to create a global decentralised user curated gallery, we are working on:

The BUY/SELL/OFFER/TRADE layer. We want users to be able to buy/sell/trade NFTs and also muse boards. Meaning that for example a Brand or an individual could even buy someone else's mood board with all the followers that may have.

We will implement a commission driven system where anyone that makes a sell in his/her muse Board gets one third of the platforms commission to manage that sale. If you as an NFT owner accept an offer or put an NFT for sale, you will need to sign accepting the terms and agreement contract allowing the `museboard` platform to charge 3% of the sale. The 3% commission is split as 1% platform, 1% platforms relay service, 1% owner of the muse board where the buyer bought the NFT)

`museboard` Relay Service.

User Messaging. 

We will soon be reinforcing the use of Vaults in order to .......

We need to make sure that Board do not get spam NFTs sent to. 

Work on the UI to match the design, allowing the use of folders inside muse Boards and the rearrangement of the NFT pieces inside the muse Board display page.
